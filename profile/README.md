# 📎 Clippy: Your Personal Data Assistant

> "It looks like the surveillance economy is extracting $8,000+ per year from you. Would you like help extracting it back?"

## 🎯 Mission

Clippy is an open-source personal data assistant that turns the surveillance economy against itself. Instead of hiding from trackers, we poison their data. Instead of accepting exploitation, we extract value back. Instead of being the product, we make surveillance expensive and unreliable.

**We don't just protect your privacy—we make privacy profitable.**

## ✨ Features

### 🎭 **Synthetic Personas**
Generate believable alternate identities that browse alongside you, making your real behavior statistically invisible in the noise.

### 💰 **Value Extraction** 
Automatically identify and claim:
- Class action settlements you're entitled to
- GDPR/CCPA compensation
- Data broker opt-out bounties
- Refunds when services change their terms
- Hidden cashback opportunities

### 🎯 **Adversarial Poisoning**
Every fake click costs advertisers money. Every poisoned data point degrades their models. We make tracking more expensive than not tracking.

### 📊 **Real-time Transparency**
See exactly what's being collected, its estimated value, and what 2,847 companies think they know about you.

### 🤖 **AI Negotiation**
Clippy monitors Terms of Service changes, negotiates better privacy settings, and alerts you when companies try to retroactively alter what you paid for.

### 🔄 **Profile Optimization**
Strategically present different versions of yourself to get better rates on insurance, credit, and services. Game the system that's gaming you.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Self-Hosted (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/getclippy/clippy.git
cd clippy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your instance
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferences

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Or deploy with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Managed Service

For those who prefer convenience over control:

1. Visit [getclippy.dev](https://getclippy.dev)
2. Create an account (no personal info required)
3. Install the browser extension
4. Watch Clippy go to work

## 🏗️ Architecture

    subgraph "Your Device"
        A[Real Data] --> B[Clippy Core]
        B --> C[Synthetic Signals]
        B --> D[Local Storage Only]
    end
    subgraph "Optional Cloud"

        F[Anonymous Metrics]
    end
    C -->|Poisoned Data| G[Internet/Trackers]
    F -.->|Statistics Only| E
```

**Zero-Knowledge Design**: Your real data never leaves your device. We can't see it, sell it, or lose it to hackers because we never have it.
